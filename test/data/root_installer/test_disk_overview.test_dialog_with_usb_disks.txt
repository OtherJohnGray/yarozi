["\nThis installer creates a ZFS root installation using Mirror or RAIDZ VDEVs. Two pools are created, a boot pool and a root pool. VDEVs are created on disk partitions, and you can specify on which disks you would like to create the partitions, as well as the number of partitions in each VDEV and the number of VDEVs in each pool. The installer will also create swap on disk partitions if you wish to do so and can encrypt and/or mirror swap for security and availability. Encrypting the root partition with LUKS or ZFS native encryption is also supported.\n\nThe following is a list of the disks in your system. Please examine them and decide how you would like to configure the VDEVs for your pools and your swap partitions, before continuing to set up your disks.
