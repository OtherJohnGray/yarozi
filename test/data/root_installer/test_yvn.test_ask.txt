["\n(This screen is very long. Use UP and DOWN arrow keys to scroll - PAGEUP and PAGEDOWN keys work also....)\n\nThe following three sceens specify the disk partitions for the VDEVs of your ZPools and swap. For maximum flexibility, this is done using Yarozi Vdev Notation (YVN). YVN specifies a ZPool as a series of white-space separated VDEV definitions. A VDEV definition is a string in the format:\n\n<VdevType>:<PartitionSize>[Disk#,...]\n\nVdevType is one of S (for Single partition VDEV), M (for mirror), or R1, R2, or R3 (for RAIDZ 1 through 3 respectively).\n\nPartitionSize is the size of each SINGLE partition to create, as <size>M (for MiB), <size>G (for GiB), <size>T (for TiB), or * (for the remaining space on the disk) - for example, 200G means that each individual partition for the VDEV will be 200 GiB. If this was a 5-disk RAIDZ-2 VDEV, then total usable size would be 600 GiB (5 - 2 multiplied by 200).\n\nDisk# is the number of the disk shown in the numbered list below. An inclusive range of disk numbers can be specified using a dash, e.g. disks 1 thru 4 can be specified as 1,2,3,4 or as 1-4.\n\nExamples:\n\nTo define a \\\"raid 0\\\" ZPool consisting of two single-partition VDEVs, made out of a 100GiB partition on disk 1 and a 100GiB partition on disk 2, with total usable pool size of 200GiB:\n\nS:100G[1] S:100G[2]\n\nTo define a \\\"raid 1\\\" ZPool consisting of a single mirror VDEV, made out of a 100GiB partition on disk 1 and a 100GiB partition on disk 2, with total usable pool size of 100GiB:\n\nM:100G[1,2]\n\nTo define a \\\"raid 10\\\" ZPool consisting of two 2-partition mirror VDEVs, made out of 100GiB partitions on disks 1 thru 4, with total usable pool size of 200GiB:\n\nM:100G[1,2] M:100G[3,4]\n\nTo define a RAIDZ2 ZPool consisting of a single 5-partition VDEV, made out of 200GiB partitions on disks 1 thru 6:\n\nR1:100G[1-6]\n\nTo achieve bit-rot resistance in a space efficient way if you only have a single drive, you can create a RAIDZ1 setup out of multiple partitons on the same drive (instead of using copies=2). for example, this definition allocates 160GiB of usable space and only 20GiB of parity:\n\nR1:20G[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\n\nThe disk numbers for your disks are as follows:\n\n1.    465 GB nvme SSD nvme-KINGSTON_SKC2500M8500G_50026B7683D3EF85 with 512 byte sectors as nvme0n1\n\n2.    465 GB nvme SSD nvme-KINGSTON_SKC2500M8500G_50026B7683D3F764 with 512 byte sectors as nvme3n1\n\n3.    465 GB nvme SSD nvme-KINGSTON_SKC2500M8500G_50026B7683D3EFCC with 512 byte sectors as nvme2n1\n\n4.    465 GB nvme SSD nvme-KINGSTON_SKC2500M8500G_50026B7683D3EF7C with 512 byte sectors as nvme5n1\n\n5.    465 GB nvme SSD nvme-KINGSTON_SKC2500M8500G_50026B7683D3F1B8 with 512 byte sectors as nvme4n1\n\n6.   1788 GB nvme SSD nvme-SAMSUNG_MZWLJ1T9HBJR-00007_S4YNNE0N700376 with 512 byte sectors as nvme1n1\n\n7.   7452 GB sata HDD ata-ST8000VN004-2M2101_WKD3276X with 512 byte sectors as sdb\n\n8.   7452 GB sata HDD ata-ST8000VN004-2M2101_WRD06Q04 with 4096 byte sectors as sda\n\n\nPlease get a piece of paper of paper or open a notepad app, and write down now the YVN definitions that you want to use for your Root pool, Boot pool, and MDRAID Swap, and then choose next to continue to the pool definition screens. You can use the back button at any time to come back to this screen for reference.\n\n", 41, 150]
