["\nThis installer creates a ZFS root installation using Mirror or RAIDZ VDEVs. Two pools are created, a boot pool and a root pool. VDEVs are created on disk partitions, and you can specify on which disks you would like to create the partitions, as well as the number of partitions in each VDEV and the number of VDEVs in each pool. The installer will also create swap on disk partitions if you wish to do so and can encrypt and/or mirror swap for security and availability. Encrypting the root partition with LUKS or ZFS native encryption is also supported.\n\nThe following is a list of the disks in your system. Please examine them and decide how you would like to configure the VDEVs for your pools and your swap partitions, before continuing to set up your disks. (if the list goes off the bottom of the screen, you can use the arrow keys and PGUP/PGDOWN to view the rest of the details. In this case a % number will be shown at the bottom right to indicate how far down the screen has scrolled...)\n\n   465 GB nvme SSD nvme-KINGSTON_SKC2500M8500G_50026B7683D3EF85 with 512 byte sectors as nvme0n1\n   465 GB nvme SSD nvme-KINGSTON_SKC2500M8500G_50026B7683D3F764 with 512 byte sectors as nvme3n1\n   465 GB nvme SSD nvme-KINGSTON_SKC2500M8500G_50026B7683D3EFCC with 512 byte sectors as nvme2n1\n   465 GB nvme SSD nvme-KINGSTON_SKC2500M8500G_50026B7683D3EF7C with 512 byte sectors as nvme5n1\n   465 GB nvme SSD nvme-KINGSTON_SKC2500M8500G_50026B7683D3F1B8 with 512 byte sectors as nvme4n1\n  1788 GB nvme SSD nvme-SAMSUNG_MZWLJ1T9HBJR-00007_S4YNNE0N700376 with 512 byte sectors as nvme1n1\n  7452 GB sata HDD ata-ST8000VN004-2M2101_WKD3276X with 512 byte sectors as sdb\n  7452 GB sata HDD ata-ST8000VN004-2M2101_WRD06Q04 with 512 byte sectors as sda", 35, 150]
